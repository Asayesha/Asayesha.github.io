      <description>Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) was created in the United States by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to provide an overall measure of highway safety. It contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.To be included in FARS, a crash must result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash.</description>
