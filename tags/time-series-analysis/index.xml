      <description>Recent global phenomena related to climate change, call for a new strategy to collectively move towards sustainable energy and reduce our carbon footprint. In one such effort, building owners are incentivised to improve building efficiencies to reduce operating costs and emissions. In this project, building energy consumption is predicted which can then be compared to the actual running costs and decide upon the incentives. Operating costs from over 1000 building over a 3 year timeframe is used to build the prediction model.</description>
